# Dotfiles

Dotfiles are all the hidden settings and configuration files you have on your Unix system.

My own dotfiles can be found [here](https://github.com/woodrowpearson/home#readme). This was a fork from a previous co-worker who has probably the most verbose and customized dotfile setup I have ever seen. I personally disable a lot & change a few things with my fork. I also will be adding [Prezto](https://github.com/sorin-ionescu/prezto) soon.
