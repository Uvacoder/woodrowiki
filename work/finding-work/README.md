# Finding work

If you are new to the industry or just starting out it can feel overwhelming trying to find a full time job; especially if you don't have the pedigree or even a CS degree. I really like this ["Find Work Programming List"](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/find-work#readme) by Nikita.

I have used [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) & [Hired](https://www.hired.com) & I have heard from friends they have had success with [Triplebyte](https://triplebyte.com) & the [monthly HN: Who is hiring? threads](https://kennytilton.github.io/whoishiring/).

My resum√©/CV came together from looking over hundreds of otheer CV's of applicants & particularly design choice to incorporate an avatar to my resume from [Martha Kelly](https://twitter.com/marthakelly). [My resume as of 03/14/2020](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oMNTEUTCtsxk3Qt2zgC0TR5cFRJY1Xeu/view?usp=sharing) I have seen others using [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template in [LaTeX](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/cv#readme).

Don't embellish or lie on your CV. But don't be intimidated to add to your CV something you may not find noteworthy. Impostor syndrome is a terrible mind game many in our field of work deal with. Don't let it stop you from putting a polished CV together and applying. You will never get a job if you don't apply. It's all a numbers game, even for industry seniors.

## Meetups

Find meetups in your city where the topic is an area you want to work in. I can't stress the importance of networking. I won't 100% agree with the old saying, "It's who you know, not what you know." But there is some truth to that statement; especially with respect to getting thee intitial interview and foot in the door.
