## Notes

- [You can pass _anything_ into context, including "subscribable" objects (like RxJS observables, etc.). This means that you can share & subscribe to streams of values that change frequently, without causing unnecessary rerenders.](https://twitter.com/DavidKPiano/status/1228700861024604160)
