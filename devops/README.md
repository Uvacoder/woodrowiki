# DevOps

So I am using this space to address both SRE & DevOps methodologies because I think it makes more sense. Both SRE and DevOps are methodologies addressing organizations' needs for production operation management. But the differences between the two doctrines are quite significant: While DevOps raise problems and dispatch them to Dev to solve, the SRE approach is to find problems and solve some of them themselves. Or to go a step further SRE's aim to design systems that are reliable, secure, and self healing.
