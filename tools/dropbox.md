# Dropbox

Dropbox is a pretty amazing service to share and keep files on the cloud. There is always privacy risks involved unless you put encrypted files in there but it is still undeniably great service.

I will update this as I try out the new Dropbox App they just launched 04/01/20. So for I like it!

It's pretty amazing as I can very easily query all the links I shared with anyone.

For sharing files temporarily I use [transfer.sh](https://transfer.sh) and [Vitor's awesome Alfred workflow](https://www.alfredforum.com/topic/5233-uploadfile-â€”-upload-files-and-directories-for-easy-sharing/) for it.

I also use Dropbox for sharing configuration of various apps.
