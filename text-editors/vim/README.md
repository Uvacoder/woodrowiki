# Vim

The best text editing experience you will ever get... Eventually. It takes a long time for all that muscle memory to build especially if you are coming from an IDE. It is worth learning it as you will start thinking about text editing differently.

## Notes

* I can profile vim startup time with [this](https://github.com/tweekmonster/startuptime.vim).
* I can run `:CheckHealth` to see if there is anything wrong with my installation \(only Neovim\).
* Get plugins that meet your needs.
* You're more likely to find useful plugins if you approach it the other way around: I want to do X, vim can't do it nicely by itself, which plugin can help me do it.
* If something doesn't work in vimrc, put the binding in the bottom of vimrc \(perhaps something overrides it\).
