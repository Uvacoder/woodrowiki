# Introduction

Stuff I've made. Stuff I've found. All stuff I want to share! I can't claim to have more than a sophomoric understanding of many of the topics I add to this gitbook. I just hope it is a resource for others or a resource wiki. To help myself learn and add value I try to explain at least my opinion or thoughts on any topic in this wiki/blog.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Woodrow, or Woody for short. I have been a practicing developer who has spent most of his short career with SRE/tools. At Uber I was in an SRE role for my entire time employed working on developing tools to reduce bottlenecks in their development. Some projects included moving our 1000+ microservices to Docker for self-service deployment. Another included automating vhost and domain registration for services needing an internal/external URL. My tendency for verbosity has lead to a love of quality documentation, and an extention to that project management. And, as of late 2019 util present I have split my time as SRE for a small company, teach high school, and coach boys high school basketball.
