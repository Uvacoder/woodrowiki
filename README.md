# Hello World

This site is my attempt to organize and digest the flood of information I have culminated over the years. I can't claim to have more than a sophomoric understanding of many of the topics I add to this wiki. While it 99.99% for my own personal use, if someone by chance stumbles in here I hope they find it useful! Under Meta, [Workflow & Structure](https://app.gitbook.com/@woodrowpearson/s/woodrow-wiki/meta/workflow-struct) I explain how the wiki is organized and the general process, and content structure.

## About Me

Hi! I'm Woodrow, or Woody for short. I have been a practicing developer for about 7 years with most roles being infrastructure or SRE roles. If you're bored you can read more about me on my LinkedIn.
