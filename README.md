# Hello World

This site is my attempt to organize and digest the flood of information I have culminated over the years. I can't claim to have more than a sophomoric understanding of many of the topics I add to this wiki. While it 99.99% for my own personal use, if someone by chance stumbles in here I hope they find it useful!

## About Me

Hi! I'm Woodrow, or Woody for short. I have been a practicing developer for about 7 years with most roles being infrastructure or SRE roles. I moved home to Washington in 2018 for family reasons. Currently I work remotely, but am seeking a position in Seattle. When not working I spend my time volunteering as a STEM high school teacher, & as a freshmen basketball coach in the Winter season.

Be humble, empathetic, & always maintain the attitude of a student.
