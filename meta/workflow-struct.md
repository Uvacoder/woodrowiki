# Worflow & Structure

## Wiki Workflow

The entire wiki is one folder that you can find on [GitHub](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge). It has many folders with subfolders or entries inside.

The order with which GitBook renders the files in the sidebar to your left is defined in [SUMMARY.md](https://github.com/woodrowpearson/gitbook-public/blob/master/SUMMARY.md)

I write & edit all the markdown files in this wiki using [iTerm 2](https://github.com/woodrowpearson/gitbook-public/tree/d77412653779627730c1ac82bc18f41e47efbcd8/macos/macos-apps/iterm/README.md) with [Neo Vim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim).

## Content Structure

Each topic will have a title, some description of it, usually my own thoughts and knowledge on it as well as referencing some resources or links I have liked or used that helped me either understand the topic or gain appreciation of it.

The structure of each of the posts will often look roughly like this:

1. Title
2. Description - My thoughts on the topic.
3. Subtopics - Various subtopics related to the main topic.
4. Notes - My own personal notes on the matter as well as things I found interesting on the internet regarding the topic. I often give a link of where I got things from.
5. Links - Links related to the topic.
