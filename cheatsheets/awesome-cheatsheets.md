## 🤔 Why Awesome-Cheatsheets?

I usually make a cheatsheet when I want to improve my skills on a programming language, a framework or a development tool. [I started doing these kind of things a long time ago on Gist](https://gist.github.com/LeCoupa). To better keep track of the history and to let people contribute, I reorganized all of them into this single repository. Most of the content is coming from official documentations and some books I have read.

Feel free to take a look. You might learn new things. They have been designed to provide a quick way to assess your knowledge and to save you time.
