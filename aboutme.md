## About Me

Woody (me) has been an SRE/tools dev that evolved from an Ad management role at Digg. From Ad management to Jr. Engineer at SocialCode I continued to develop and find what areas I was drawn to. At Uber I was in an SRE role for my entire time employed. I continued tool, deployment, but parrticularly project management at Pandora. And, as of late 2019 util present I have split my time as SRE for a small company, teach high school, and coach boys high school basketball.
