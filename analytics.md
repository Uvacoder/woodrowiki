# Analytics

A collection of tools and software for quantifying personal data about how I spend my days & analytic software for work. That said, I am a firm follower of quantified self movement and I [track and aggregate]() a lot of valuable data about myself and what I do. Specifically I heavily use [Timing](https://github.com/woodrowpearson/life-wiki/tree/16a9361766d9d55fd3abb798fd99d739e033361c/macOS/apps/timing.md) and [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com) to track how I use my time. And I always try to be [mindful](https://github.com/woodrowpearson/life-wiki/tree/16a9361766d9d55fd3abb798fd99d739e033361c/mindfulness/mindfulness.md) of the time I spend.

For user facing products, well implemented analytics will let you see how to optimize your system to serve some end goals better and for that you need data.
