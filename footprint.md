# Footprint

Unlike real life, I don't have a large footprint on the internet. Especially contributions to opensource, or public personal projects. My consumption to contribution to the internet is sub-standard. But here is the stuff I have done that I can share publically. Outside of Linkedin, Github, & Instagram you won't find much else. But here is all is anyway.

A mix of one liners, snippets, and interview question answers I have compiled. This site is relatively new so I apologize for it being a bit difficult to navigate.
