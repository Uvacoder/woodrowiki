# Footprint

Unlike real life, I don't have a large footprint on the internet. My OSS contributions are practically non-existant, but here is the stuff I have done that I can share publically. Outside of Linkedin, Github, & Instagram you won't find much else, but I wrote a short cover letter to add some color to get a better pictute of who I am.

A mix of one liners, snippets, and interview question answers I have compiled. This site is relatively new so I apologize for it being a bit difficult to navigate.
