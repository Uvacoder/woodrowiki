# [Stylish](https://userstyles.org) themes

I prefer to use dark interfaces on websites where it's available. Previously I used [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app) Safari Extension to change the looks of sites to have darker colors. The extension lets you import any of [Stylish themes](https://userstyles.org). Here is a [download of all the Cascadea styles I used](https://www.dropbox.com/s/dcnhujryt0ydft5/Cascadea%20Styles.sdb?dl=1). For sites I didn't modify with Cascadea, I ran [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/) extension which automatically turns all websites dark and does quite a good job at that.

I don't use either of those extensions now and am waiting for official releases of dark modes for all websites.

Below are some Stylish themes I used:
