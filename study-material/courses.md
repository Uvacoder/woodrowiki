# Courses

I love how websites like [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) pioneered the abundance of free MOOCs by many awesome institutions and professors.

As an SRE I can't speak highly enough about [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/). Courses for anyone at any skill level. Multiple cloud support. VM labs to practice and simulate real problems. They have great support and the content is updated very often.



I keep a Google sheet doc to track courses I plan to take.
